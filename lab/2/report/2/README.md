## Passive Buzzer

We made a sketch which reads the value from the serial port and that will give this value for the frequency of the buzzer. To do so, we used the function tone().
It has three attributes : the pin number, the frequency, and the duration of the sound.

## LDR Sensor

We made a sketch with a LDR sensor, which detects the lightness. The more light there is, the higher the value printed on the serial value will be. On the other hand, if we cover the sensor, the value will be lower.
