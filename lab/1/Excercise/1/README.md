# Exercise 1

We tried to control the brightness of a LED without a microcontroller and with a microcontroller.

## Without the microcontroller

We used the Arduino:

## With the microcontroller

Then we used the ESP32 microcontroller:

# Conclusion

The most efficient way to control the brightness of a LED is to do it with the Arduino, that is to say without the ESP32 microcontroller. It is better because it does not require any external circuit and we can control the brightness more precisely.
